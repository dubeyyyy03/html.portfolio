    <h3>1. Avengers-Endgame (2019)</h3>

      The 3-hour culmination of 22 chapters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is
      worth going back in time and watching again.

    <h3>2. RRR (2022)</h3>

      The action scenes were just as badass. It's so hilariously ridiculous and
      stupid that I loved it. It's basically a superhero movie. The two actors
      were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining. The
      story itself was not bad, even though it dragged so much during the middle
      part
    </p>

    <h3>3. Interstellar (2014)</h3>

    <p>
      Interstellar, though ambitious and thrilling at points, is too complicated
      and doesn't reach its full potential.
